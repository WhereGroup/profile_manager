# Export profile for QGIS Deployment Toolbelt (QDT)

Profile Manager is frequently used as a preparation tool before automated deployment.

![Profile Manager - Export for QDT](../static/profile_manager_ui_tab_QDT-export.png)

Typical workflow:

1. Create or update a reference QGIS profile
2. Validate plugins and configuration
3. Use Profile Manager to refine or synchronize configuration elements
4. Export or integrate the profile into QDT deployment scenarios
5. Deploy profiles across workstations

This approach helps maintain consistency while allowing controlled updates.
