# Best Practices

## Maintain Reference Profiles

Always maintain a validated baseline profile used for deployment and updates.

## Validate Plugin Compatibility

Ensure that installed plugins:

* Are compatible with the QGIS version
* Do not conflict with organizational policies

## Test Before Distribution

Always test profiles on a clean QGIS environment before large-scale deployment.

## Keep Backups

Profiles contain critical configuration data. Regular backups help prevent accidental data loss.
